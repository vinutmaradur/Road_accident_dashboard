## Road Accident Dashboard 🚗💥🚙

## Project Overview 📊

This project presents an interactive dashboard for analyzing road accident data. The dashboard provides insights into accident trends, severity,
vehicle involvement, road types, lighting conditions, and surface conditions to assist in understanding accident patterns and enhancing road safety measures.

## Features 🎯

- **Total Casualties Overview:** Displays the total number of casualties, including fatal, serious, and slight casualties.

- **Casualties by Vehicle Type:** Breaks down casualties based on vehicle type (cars, motorcycles, trucks, etc.).

- **Monthly Trend Analysis:** Compares current year (CY) casualties against previous year (PY) casualties.

- **Casualties by Road Type:** Analyzes accidents based on road types such as single carriageways, dual carriageways, roundabouts, etc.

- **Casualties by Location:** Differentiates accidents in urban and rural areas.

- **Casualties by Light Conditions:** Highlights accidents occurring in daylight versus dark conditions.

- **Casualties by Road Surface:** Examines the impact of road conditions (dry, wet, snow/ice) on accidents.

- **Filter Panel:** Allows users to filter data based on accident date and urban/rural location.
